# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository!

## 1. Before You Start
- Ensure your fork is up to date with the main repository.
- Use clear, concise commit messages.
- Open an issue before starting major changes.

## 2. Creating a Branch
- Create a new branch for your work.
- Use a descriptive branch name:

```
feature/<feature-name>
fix/<issue-name>
update/<component>
```
Example: `feature/add-login-page`

## 3. Making Changes
- Keep your changes focused and minimal.
- Follow existing code style and formatting.
- Run tests before committing.

## 4. Commit Messages
Write meaningful commit messages:
```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

```
Examples:
```
fix(ui): correct button alignment
feat(auth): add JWT-based authentication

```

## 5. Submitting a Pull Request
When ready:
1. Push your branch to your fork.
2. Open a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch.

## 6. Code Review
- Be open to feedback.
- Make requested changes promptly.
- Do not merge your own PRs unless authorized.

## 7. After Merge
- Delete your branch after it’s merged.
- Sync your local `main` branch with the upstream repository.

### Best Practices
- Keep PRs small and focused. (100 - 300 LOC)
- Write comments for non-obvious logic.
- Update documentation when modifying behavior.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
